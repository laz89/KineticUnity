You can use the level blocking tools to make walls of any length to fit these end posts.
After making a block, apply the brick material to the wall with a scale of 0.6
Create another small block for the top trim piece and apply the cement material to it.
See the AssetDemoProject (project) DemoSceno01 (scene) for an example of how this works with the existing meshes.
